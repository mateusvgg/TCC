# TCC
This repository stores the code from my undergraduate thesis. It creates a data-driven full-reference metric for Point Clouds Quality Assessment (PCQA). 

We leverage [Alireza's code](https://github.com/AlirezaJav/Projection-based-PC-Quality-Metric) for generating the projections and [Keyan Ding's code](https://github.com/dingkeyan93/DISTS) as a base for our model.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9.7 or above
* Packages in `requirements.txt`
